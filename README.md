# airplanes
A simulation for flying airplanes

# Setup

The airplane visualization is implemented with Turtle graphics. A very, very basic 
UI and backed by Python.

Note: If you are on a macOS and using the python that was installed automatically
on your machine then you may have trouble running the program. To fix this, you 
will need to install Python yourself. See here for more:

We use `pipenv` to manage the virtual environment which has just a single dependency
for the turtle graphics. 



TODO: Remove the pipenv, it is using the default installed python
# Update Docs

If you have trouble, you may be running the default installed python
You will need to install python yourself, see here
