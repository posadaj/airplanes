# Overview
This is a simple UI project to simulate flying an airplane on a 2D map.

The project is implemted with Turtle graphics and written in python. Turtle graphics is a simple drawing tool that provides simple instructions for navigating an object on a 2D map.

# Setup
The project has just a single python library `turtle` which comes pre-installed
with `python`. So setup is as simple as having python3 installed. Python2 may
work as well but this project was only tested with python3.

# Run the app
Run with `python3 main.py`

### Airplane Controls

Use the arrow keys to control the speed and yaw angle (direction) of the airplane:
- Up : Increase the airplane's speed
- Down: Reduce the airplane's speed
- Left: Rotate the airplane to the left
- Right: Rotate the airplane to the right

### Airplane Reset
After flying the plane for a bit, you may want to reset the airplane
to its original location. You can do so by pressing the `return` key
