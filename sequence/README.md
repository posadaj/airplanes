## Overview


This project is simple implementation and visualization of the layup sequence written in Python3.

The dependencies are managed by `pipenv`. See here XXX for instructions on how to install.

With pipenv installed, we just need to install the virtual environment with:
```
pipenv install --dev
```

And then we can run the script with
```
python3 main.py
```
